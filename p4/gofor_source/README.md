This repository contains the source code of GOFOR-SR and the script to generate the figures.

To run the experiments **with only docker installed:**

* run the script run-in-docker.sh
* open the jupyter notebook by copying the url printed in the terminal in your favorite browser
* follow the instructions of the notebook

**Note:** On windows, to run docker without mounting a volume, you can read the instruction in the file "run-in-docker.sh"

**Alternatively, you can open the notebook directly, without docker,** just open the notebook in the folder "evaluation/")
